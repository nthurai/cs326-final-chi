4. Innovative Idea
- Our idea involves creating a fitness optimization website. Specifically this web app differs on its implemented solution. Instead of the traditional design a workout, save it, upload it to the service this service has the user input what they have already
done and the site will make background computations and recommend exercises that the user should be doing in order to optimize their fitness routine. This is different from group Gamma which is doing a upload and share fitness plans project since this is
essentially a completely different way to solve a similar issue. The emphasis on our solution is to optimizate total body fatigue instead of just becoming a repository for different workouts. This also allows users to focus on standard growth patterns and
does not have that same aspect of a social database where users can interact in favor of individualized recommended workouts. This way of tracking fitness has no similar solutions currently, which makes this idea a unique approach to the entire model of 
exercise and fitness.
5. Important Components
- There are several distinct compents that will be incorporated into the solution. The UI will be a basic interface with a div to enter info about the user, a basic stats sheet, and an area with recommended workouts for the user. The UI will incorporate 
Bootstrap to improve overall readability. This UI also allows users to interact with and edit their saved data in the HTML itself. Each user will have an individual profile, which means that each user will have a profile and the client must connect to a server 
(TypeScript-based) to retrieve relavaent info. This design also supports the login/logout feature of the project and authenicates users allowing them to access their own data.
